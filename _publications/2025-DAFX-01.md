# Abstract:
Most real systems, from acoustics to analog electronics, are characterised by bidirectional coupling amongst elements rather than neat, unidirectional signal flows between self-contained modules. Integrating digital processing into physical domains becomes a significant engineering challenge when the application requires bidirectional coupling across the physical-digital boundary rather than separate, well-defined inputs and outputs. We introduce an approach to hybrid analog-digital audio processing using synthetic impedance: digitally simulated circuit elements integrated into an otherwise analog circuit. This approach combines the physicality and classic character of analog audio circuits alongside the precision and flexibility of digital signal processing (DSP). Our impedance synthesis system consists of a voltage-controlled current source and a microcontroller-based DSP system. We demonstrate our technique through modifying an iconic guitar distortion pedal, the Boss DS-1, showing the ability of the synthetic impedance to both replicate and extend the behaviour of the pedal’s diode clipping stage. We discuss the behaviour of the synthetic impedance in isolated laboratory conditions and in the DS-1 pedal, highlighting the technical and creative potential of the technique as well as its practical limitations and future extensions.
